I'm a soon to be graduate of the Computational Linguistics program at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. I'm interested in applied research and engineering at the intersection of machine learning and natural langugae processing. Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis on using syntactic complexity measures to predict task-item level performance with large language models.

Right now, I'm also looking for positions where I can put my skills to good use, building applications and infrastructure to connect SOTA deep learning models to end users and solving real world problems.

For better or for worse, I've always been something of a generalist in tech and am looking for opportunities to develop deeper expertise in applied ML/NLP.
